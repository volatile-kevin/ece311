    "# Lab 6: Filter Design\n",
    "## Due Date: 11/16 @ 11:59PM\n",
    "\n",
    "We will turn our attention to filter design in this lab and consider some practical design trade-offs in creating effective filters. In Exercises 1 and 2, we will try out two popular methods of FIR filter design and apply one of them in Exercise 3 to clean up a noisy audio signal. Exercise 4 will explore the benefit of linear phase and Exercise 5 will give us a look at more sophisticated, modern filtering techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FIR and IIR Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "LSI digital filters can be separated into two types: Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters. FIR filters have finitely many terms, only use input signal values, and are always BIBO stable since they have no poles other than at $z=0$. Conversely, IIR filters have infinitely many terms in their impulse response, use both input signal and previous output signal values, and can be BIBO unstable if their ROC does not contain the unit circle in the complex z-domain. In the z-domain, we see that FIR filters have a constant denominator of one in their transfer function, while IIR filters will have some polynomial in their transfer function's denominator according to the system feedback in the LCCDE. We will primarily focus on FIR filter design in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the elements of a filter's transfer function in the below figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"filter-metrics.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three key aspects to consider:\n",
    "* Passband ripple - The passband ripple shows how much the frequency resposne varies in the frequencies we would like to keep. Ideally, the passband should be flat so each frequency in the passband is emphasized equally.\n",
    "* Stopband Attenuation - The stopband attenuation tells us how much rejected frequencies will be suppressed. Clearly, we would like the stopband attenuation to be as strong as possible to removed unwanted frequency content.\n",
    "* Transition bandwidth - Transition bandwidth is given by the bandwidth between the passband edge and stopband edge. We would like a narrow transition band to make sure we clearly accept and reject the appropriate frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any other design problem, there is a tradeoff between these parameters with how expensive (how large) the filter is or the method by which we create the filter. Exercise 1 will explore some of these tradeoffs. Now let's consider how we may go about designing an FIR filter."

    "$$\n",
    "H_d(\\omega) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "1,\\quad |\\omega| < \\omega_c\\\\\n",
    "0,\\quad \\omega_c \\leq |\\omega| \\leq \\pi\n",
    "\\end{cases},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\omega_c \\in [0,\\pi]$ is the cut-off frequency of our filter. Note that this ideal frequency response has a constant phase response ($H_d(\\omega)$ is real-valued in this case)! Following the DTFT pair of interest, we would obtain the following impulse response for our ideal low-pass filter:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_d[n] = \\begin{cases} \\frac{\\sin \\omega_c n}{\\pi n},\\quad n\\neq 0\\\\\n",

    "Notice that this impulse response is even symmetric. This even symmetry guarantees that our frequency response will have constant phase. Now, there are two problems with this representation of our filter:\n",

    "2. It is non-causal since we have non-zero impulse response values for $n < 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is one way we can resolve these two issues? With the windowing method!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Windowing Method\n",
    "We may limit the length of our filter by choosing to keep only the middle $N$ samples and guarantee causality by shifting our impulse response by $M = \\frac{N-1}{2}$. This way, our impulse response will be for $0\\leq n \\leq N-1$. Recall from our DTFT properties that a shift in the time domain will give linear phase in the frequency domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x[n-M] \\leftrightarrow e^{-jM\\omega}X_d(\\omega).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"causal delay\" $M$ is what gives us our linear phase in FIR filter design since the ideal response had constant phase. If we put all these steps together, we arrive at the following design process for an FIR filter using the windowing method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let $D(\\omega)$ be your ideal frequency response like $H_d(\\omega)$ above.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply linear phase to compensate for the necessary causal shift in the time domain to obtain $G(\\omega)$, where $M = \\frac{N-1}{2}$ and $N$ is the filter length.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G(\\omega) = D(\\omega)e^{-jM\\omega}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Take the inverse DTFT of $G(\\omega)$ to obtain your shifted, infinite-length filter\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g[n] = \\textrm{DTFT}^{-1}\\{G(\\omega)\\} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}G(\\omega)e^{j\\omega n}d\\omega\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Apply a window function centered at $n=M$ and of length $N$ to guarantee the causality and finiteness of your filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h[n] = g[n]w[n],\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w[n]$ is the window function centered at $n=M$. As we discussed in Lab 5, these windowing functions may take on a number of shapes like the rectangular window, Hamming window, and so on. The choice of window will affect important elements of our frequency response like the passband ripple, stopband attenuation, and transition bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear and Generalized Linear Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started with the lab activities, we should briefly discuss what identifies linear and generalized linear phase responses. Suppose we have the following frequency response:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_d(\\omega) = R(\\omega)e^{j(\\alpha - \\omega M)},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R(\\omega)$ is real-valued, $\\alpha$ is a real-valued constant, and $M=\\frac{N-1}{2}$ is our causal delay. Clearly, the phase response of this DTFT has some kind of linear form since we see a linear function in the complex exponential's exponent. So, how do we decide if this phase is linear or generalized linear? A phase response is purely linear if the constant $\\alpha$ is zero. Thus, we have generalized linear phase when $\\alpha \\neq 0$. Still, in practice, generalized linear phase is typically acceptable since it will offer the important benefits of linear phase. We will revisit the importance of linear phase in Exercise 3.\n",

    "## An Introduction to Adaptive Filtering and LMS Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, we have worked with carefully designed LSI filters. We took some knowledge of the signal in the time and/or frequency domain and devised an approriate filter. Consider the scenarios where we have uncertainty or randmoness in our signal, design constraints that are too difficult to work with by hand, or simply lack necessary information about the system. Perhaps as we go through our signal we would find one filter is best in the first third, another in the middle, and a third filter is optimal at the end of the signal. Designing or tuning three filters by hand and specifically deploying them on segments of the signal is too much work! What if we could learn an optimal filter \"on-the-fly\" or \"on-line\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is the central goal behind adaptive filtering. Adaptive filtering is found in many applications including noise-canceling headphones and echo/reverberation cancellation. When creating an adaptive filter, we would like our filter to adjust its own coefficients as it processes the signal. How does it do this? By observing the errors in the output it produces and altering its coefficients to mitigate these errors. This way, we do not need to precisely design our filter; instead, we just give it the mechanism for updating itself! Now, let's take a look at the math and underlying theory for one type of adaptive filtering: Least Mean Squares (LMS) filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of LMS filtering is to use previous memory of input signal values to predict the desired output value. As such, when doing LMS filtering, we typically have a reference output signal that we are trying to emulate. Consider the context where we know the ideal (reference) output, but we do not know the filter that will turn our input into this ideal output. Therefore, we would like to tune our filter's coefficients such that our filter applied to the memory of input values will produce a strong prediction of the ideal output at each sample. Let $x[n]$ be the input to our LSI system, $w$ be our adaptive filter of length $L$, $y[n]$ be our filter's output, and $d[n]$ be the reference output. This scenario, also known as single step prediction, is depicted by the below figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"adaptive-filter.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We may determine our output $y[n]$ by computing $y[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}w[k]x[n-k]$. In this figure, $e[n] = d[n]-y[n]$ represents the error signal from our output predictions. We would like to use this error signal to inform our filter and update its values. How can we perform these updates? Through an algorithm known as gradient descent. Gradient descent is a tremendously popular iterative algorithm used in several fields including deep learning, optimization, and many more. Recall from calculus that we can find a minimum or maximum of a function by setting its derivative to zero. Gradient descent extends this intuition to higher-dimensional functions where instead we would like the gradient to be zero. We may formulate the gradient descent update step as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w^{(n+1)} = w^{(n)} - \\alpha\\nabla C(w^{(n)}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we take the gradient of a cost function $C$ that we would like to minimize with respect to our adaptive filter $w$. Again, take note that we apply gradient descent at each sample index to update our filter before processing the next sample in our signal. The superscript $n$ denotes the iteration number of our gradient descent algorithm. The gradient descent formula updates our filter by having it step in the direction of the $\\textit{negative gradient}$ at each iteration. This way, we expect to decrease our gradient until (hopefully) it goes to zero and we minimize our cost. Imagine gradient descent like you are trying to walk down a hill. At each step you take, you will choose to step in the steepest direction of descent until you reach the bottom (our optimal filter). Above, the parameter $\\alpha$ is referred to as the learning rate. The learning rate determines how large our gradient updates are. We must take great care in tuning $\\alpha$ since if $\\alpha$ is too large, we may over-update at each step (imagine jumping from one hilltop to another hilltop) and never converge and if $\\alpha$ is too small, we may converge too slowly (imagine taking a \"baby step\" to go down a large hill). We will examine this further in Exercise 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's make the update to our LMS filter more concrete. What we need is a cost function that is a function of our filter coefficients. We can find this by considering our filter's squared prediction errors. Using the same notation from before,\n",
